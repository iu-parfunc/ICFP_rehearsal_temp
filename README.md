# ICFP_rehearsal_feedback

Repository to collect feedback on practice talks..

Here's the procedure:

 1. Create one issue per practice talk.
 2. Add comments to that issue for feedback.

That is, we're not using the repo contents, just the issues.  This simply leverages github as a mechanism to combine concurrent comments.  (As opposed to Google Doc, where collisions can be a problem with too many concurrent edits.)
