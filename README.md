Feedback for David's talk on Elaborator Reflection

Jeremy:
  * The introduction should give more examples of the kinds of language
    extensibility and meta programming that you're aiming to support.
  * The slide sequence makes it sounds like Elab. Refl. is primarily a monad.
    While it is a monad, that's not very informative. Lots of things are monads.
    The important thing is that it provides access to the Elaborator.
    The presentation should focus on the Elab. operations and how they can be used 
    together with other features of Idris, including other meta programming features.
    The subsequent examples ramp up too quickly, so it's difficult to spot what
    features are being used and combined.
